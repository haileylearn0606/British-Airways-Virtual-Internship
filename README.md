# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience

This repository contains the work I completed during the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience** in November 2022. The project demonstrates my skills in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **predictive modeling**, and **data analysis** to understand customer sentiments and buying behavior.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews and build a predictive model for understanding and improving customer buying behavior. The primary tasks included:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Scraped and collected reviews about customer experiences with British Airways from the **SkyTrax** website.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **N-gram analysis** to analyze customer sentiments.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Preprocessed data for machine learning.
   - Resampled the dataset to address imbalances.
   - Trained and optimized a **predictive model** to classify and predict customer buying behavior.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Iteratively improved the predictive model to achieve better results.
